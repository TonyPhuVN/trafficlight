- **Setup Scripts**: Multiple initialization scripts for different deployment needs
- **Validation**: Complete error handling and validation for all settings
- **Vietnamese Support**: Configuration supports Vietnamese text and locations

### Error Handling Strategy - PROVEN PATTERNS
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality when components fail
- **Component Isolation**: One component failure shouldn't crash the entire system
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **User Notification**: Clear error messages in Vietnamese for operators
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant memory bank files
5. **Performance**: Benchmark critical paths

### Debugging Patterns
- **Logging Levels**: DEBUG for development, INFO for production
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests through the entire system
- **Performance Profiling**: Use cProfile for bottleneck identification
- **Component Status**: Health checks for all major components
- **Data Validation**: Validate all external inputs (camera frames, sensor data)

### Deployment Patterns
- **Environment Separation**: Clear dev/staging/production configurations
- **Database Migrations**: Always test migrations on staging first
- **Rollback Strategy**: Keep previous version deployable
- **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for production monitoring

## Hardware Integration

### Camera Management
- **Initialization**: Graceful handling of missing cameras
- **Frame Processing**: Skip frames if processing falls behind
- **Error Recovery**: Reconnect cameras automatically on failure
- **Calibration**: Store calibration data in database, reload on startup
- **Multi-camera**: Process cameras in parallel for performance

### Sensor Integration
- **MQTT**: Use QoS 1 for sensor data reliability
- **Data Validation**: Validate sensor readings before processing
- **Failure Handling**: Continue operation with degraded sensor data
- **Calibration**: Regular sensor calibration with historical baselines
- **Protocol**: Support multiple sensor types with abstraction layer

### Traffic Light Control
- **Safety First**: Always maintain minimum safety timing requirements
- **Manual Override**: Allow operators to take control instantly
- **State Validation**: Verify all state changes before applying
- **Emergency Protocols**: Immediate response for emergency vehicles
- **Logging**: Log all control actions with timestamps and reasons

## User Experience Patterns

### Dashboard Design
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data
- **Vietnamese UI**: All user-facing text in Vietnamese
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on tablets and phones
- **Performance**: Dashboard updates without blocking user interaction
- **Error States**: Clear error messages and recovery instructions

### API Design
- **RESTful**: Standard REST patterns for CRUD operations
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for API access
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Versioning**: API versioning for backward compatibility

## Maintenance and Operations

### Monitoring
- **System Health**: Monitor all component status continuously
- **Performance Metrics**: Track processing times, accuracy, throughput
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable alerting for anomalies
- **Log Retention**: Archive logs for historical analysis

- **Documentation**: Keep Memory Bank updated with all changes

## Vietnamese Language Considerations
- **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 throughout the system
- **Date/Time**: Vietnamese locale for user-facing timestamps
- **Number Formatting**: Vietnamese number formatting conventions
- **Error Messages**: Contextual Vietnamese error messages
- **Help Text**: Comprehensive Vietnamese help documentation

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Real-time Performance**: Sub-2-second response time is non-negotiable
2. **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime requirement for traffic safety
3. **Accuracy**: >90% vehicle detection accuracy for effective optimization
4. **Safety**: Traffic light control must always maintain safety protocols
5. **Scalability**: System must support multiple intersections efficiently

These patterns and preferences ensure consistent, high-quality development that meets the specific needs of Vietnamese traffic management while maintaining international technical standards.
