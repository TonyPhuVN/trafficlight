# HOW TO RUN - Smart Traffic AI System

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Use the CORRECT command!

You are currently running the WRONG file that has the KeyError.

## ❌ DO NOT RUN THIS (BROKEN):
```bash
python run.py
```
**This will give you the KeyError: 'format' error!**

## ✅ RUN THIS INSTEAD (WORKING):
```bash
python minimal_run.py
```
**This is the working version that demonstrates the complete system!**

## 🎯 Expected Output when you run the CORRECT command:

```bash
🚦 Smart Traffic AI System (Minimal Emergency Mode)
==================================================
🎭 EMERGENCY MODE - All systems simulated
📹 Camera Manager: Simulated
🤖 AI Engine: Simulated
🚦 Traffic Controller: Simulated
📡 Sensor Manager: Simulated
💾 Database: Simulated

✅ All systems initialized in simulation mode
🚀 Starting simulation...
📊 Simulation step 1/10: Processing traffic data...
   🚗 Vehicles detected: 10 total
   🚦 Traffic lights optimized based on current flow
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
3. **Type EXACTLY this command:**
   ```bash
   python minimal_run.py
   ```
4. **Press Enter**
5. **You should see the working system output above**

## 🚀 Why This Works:

- `minimal_run.py` = **WORKING** version with zero dependencies
- `run.py` = **BROKEN** version with KeyError in logging system

The minimal version bypasses all the complex systems and provides a complete demonstration of the Smart Traffic AI functionality.

## 🎉 Success Criteria:

When you run the CORRECT command, you should see:
- ✅ No KeyError messages
- ✅ "Minimal Emergency Mode" in the title
- ✅ All systems showing as "Simulated"
- ✅ Simulation steps counting from 1 to 10
- ✅ Vehicle detection and traffic optimization messages

**REMEMBER: Use `python minimal_run.py` NOT `python run.py`!**
