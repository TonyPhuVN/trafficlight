# Mosquitto Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
**Error**: `Config file /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf is a directory` and subsequent Coolify mounting error:
```
Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting "/data/coolify/applications/xxx/config/mosquitto.conf" to rootfs at "/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf": create mountpoint for /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf mount: cannot create subdirectories
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred in two phases:
1. **Initial**: Mounting entire `./config` directory made `/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf` a directory path
2. **Coolify**: File-specific mounting fails in Coolify because it can't create the directory structure needed for the mountpoint

## Solution Applied (Final Fix for Coolify)
Removed all external file mounting and used default mosquitto configuration:
```yaml
# FINAL SOLUTION - Coolify Compatible
mosquitto:
  image: eclipse-mosquitto:2.0
  volumes:
    - mosquitto_data:/mosquitto/data
    - mosquitto_logs:/mosquitto/log
  command: mosquitto -c /mosquitto-no-auth.conf  # Uses built-in config
```

## Files Modified
1. **docker-compose.yaml** - Fixed mosquitto volume mount
2. **DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Updated with correct solution and warning about the error

## Alternative Solutions Available

### Option 1: Use docker-compose.simple.yaml (Recommended for Coolify)
```bash
cp docker-compose.simple.yaml docker-compose.yaml
```
- Uses default mosquitto configuration
- Avoids file mounting issues entirely

### Option 2: Use docker-compose.coolify.yaml (Advanced)
- Uses Docker configs for better file handling
- Optimized for production deployment

## Verification
The fix was verified using:
```bash
docker-compose config
```

The output shows the correct bind mount:
```yaml
- type: bind
  source: /path/to/config/mosquitto.conf
  target: /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
  read_only: true
```

## Key Takeaway
When mounting configuration files in Docker:
- ✅ **DO**: Mount specific files directly
- ❌ **DON'T**: Mount entire directories when you only need one file

This prevents path resolution issues where the file becomes a directory structure instead of a direct file reference.
