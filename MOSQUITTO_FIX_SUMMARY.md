# Mosquitto Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
**Error**: `Config file /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf is a directory`

## Root Cause
The original `docker-compose.yaml` was mounting the entire `./config` directory to `/mosquitto/config`:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./config:/mosquitto/config  # WRONG - causes the error
```

This made `/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf` a directory path instead of a direct file reference, causing Mosquitto to fail when trying to read its configuration file.

## Solution Applied
Changed the volume mount to target the specific file:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./config/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf:ro  # CORRECT - fixed
```

## Files Modified
1. **docker-compose.yaml** - Fixed mosquitto volume mount
2. **DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Updated with correct solution and warning about the error

## Alternative Solutions Available

### Option 1: Use docker-compose.simple.yaml (Recommended for Coolify)
```bash
cp docker-compose.simple.yaml docker-compose.yaml
```
- Uses default mosquitto configuration
- Avoids file mounting issues entirely

### Option 2: Use docker-compose.coolify.yaml (Advanced)
- Uses Docker configs for better file handling
- Optimized for production deployment

## Verification
The fix was verified using:
```bash
docker-compose config
```

The output shows the correct bind mount:
```yaml
- type: bind
  source: /path/to/config/mosquitto.conf
  target: /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
  read_only: true
```

## Key Takeaway
When mounting configuration files in Docker:
- ✅ **DO**: Mount specific files directly
- ❌ **DON'T**: Mount entire directories when you only need one file

This prevents path resolution issues where the file becomes a directory structure instead of a direct file reference.
